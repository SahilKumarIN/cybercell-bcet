                In the digital corridors of Bengal College of Engineering and
                Technology, a group of passionate computer science students
                noticed a growing concern. As cyber threats evolved and
                multiplied, there was a significant gap between academic
                cybersecurity education and real-world application.
              </p>
              <p class="story-paragraph">
                Founded in 2021 by a dedicated team of final-year students,
                CyberCell BCET emerged from a simple yet powerful vision: to
                create a platform where students could not just learn about
                cybersecurity in theory, but actively engage with it, practice
                it, and contribute to the broader security community.
              </p>
              <p class="story-paragraph">
                What started as weekly meetups in a small classroom has now
                grown into one of the most active technical clubs of the
                college, with over 50+ active members.

            <h2>Our Leadership Philosophy</h2>
            <p class="philosophy-intro">
              At CyberCell BCET, we believe that great leaders are not born,
              they are forged through experience, mentorship, and the courage to
              take on challenges.

                <h4>Student-Led Initiative</h4>
                <p>
                  Every major decision in our club is made by students, for
                  students. Our leadership structure ensures that the voice of
                  every member is heard and considered.

                <h4>Mentorship Culture</h4>
                <p>
                  Senior members actively mentor juniors, creating a continuous
                  cycle of knowledge transfer and skill development that
                  strengthens our entire community.

                <p>
                  We believe in empowering multiple leaders rather than relying
                  on a single figurehead. This approach ensures sustainability
                  and diverse perspectives.
